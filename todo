* We have estimated force of infection (0.660 per year) from Hedger
  1972 to get an endemic equilibrium. Applying the transmission rates
  estimated from our data to this endemic equilibrium gives a much
  higher force of infection (5ish per year), which causes a fast
  increase in infectious and chronic.
** Can we solve the PDEs iteratively with the force of infection to get
   an endemic equilibrium without using Hedger's data?
** What if we approximate the gamma waiting times by exponential with
   the same mean so that we get a system of ODEs intead of PDEs?
* Think about not having all calves born with immunity.

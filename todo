* Investigate samples that break
  `herd.initial_conditions.immune_state.solve()`
** Should we just clip them to be non-negative?

* Compare susceptibility_null to old model

* Write up: herd.initial_conditions.immune_status.Solver.get_pdf() now
  sets pdf[0] = 0.
** Should we see how (hazard_infection, newborn_proportion_immune) in
   herd.initial_conditions.immune_status.Solver.solve() change as we
   vary the value of pdf[0]?

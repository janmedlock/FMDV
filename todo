* initial conditions
** conditional probability
*** SAT1: 12.6min, hazard_infection = 28.0, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.935
*** SAT2: 13.6min, hazard_infection = 19.6, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.843
*** SAT3: 28.7min, hazard_infection = 13.8, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.820
** nonconditional probability
*** SAT1: 11.9min, hazard_infection = 153.8, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.958
*** SAT2: 15.1min, hazard_infection = 137.7, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.899
*** SAT3: 22.6min, hazard_infection =  82.9, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.907
*** Why are the hazards so large?!?

* Check hazards of infection => equilibrium prevalence for the SATs.
** Why are the density vs. age, summed over immune state, so different
   between the SATs? Is this the \Delta a terms in the analysis of the
   numerical scheme breaking things?
** What do hazards imply about prevalence?
*** Look at fraction in each state at equilibrium.
*** Look at hazard and S + L by SAT.
    How do these relate to each other?
*** Chronics => lots of transmission?
**  Could there be multiple equilibria?

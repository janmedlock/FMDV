* buffalo.herd.initial_conditions.immune_status: Implement the
  constant-time birth rate.
* Check if the i = 0 terms from \bar{F} fix the analysis issues.

* Should we just solve for the equilibrium of the probability of being
  in state X at age a, *not* conditioned on being alive at age a? It's
  a simpler problem to explain...
  This makes the conditional probability
  P_X(a) = Q_X(a) / \sum_X Q_X(a),
  which can then be used with q(a), the probability density of age a,
  from age_structure for the initial conditions.
** We'd need to add mortality.
** The birth rate that gives a constant population is
   b = 1 / \int_4^{+\infty} S_{\mathrm{mortality}}(a) da.
   That is
   1 / b = - 0.66 * 0.79 ** 2 * 0.88 * (
   (1 - 0.88 ** 8) / log(0.88)
   + 0.88 ** 8 / log(0.66)
   ),
   or b \approx 0.4696.
** The rate of births with and without immunity become linear in this
   version.

* Think about not having all calves born with immunity.
** Make another parameter \phi for the fraction born with immunity,
   P_M(0) = \phi and P_S(0) = 1 - \phi.
   After solving for the P_X(a), we can compute p as
   \phi = \frac{\sum_{X \in \{M, R, C\}} R_X}{\sum_X R_X},
   with
   R_X = \int_4^{+\infty} P_X(a) q(a) da,
   where q(a) is the probability density of age a, from age_structure.
   This parameter \phi and the comparison with its post-solution value
   is another variable to add to the root finding.
** Approximate the above with
   \phi = \frac{\sum_{X \in \{M, R, C\}} R_X}{\sum_X R_X}
   and
   R_X = \int_4^{+\infty} P_X(a) da,
   i.e. don't include q(a). Since the \sum_X P_X(a) = 1 for all a, the
   denominator is constant, so we have a linear problem. This will
   require some work to define the matrices for the solver.

* For the initial conditions, what if we approximate the gamma waiting
  times by exponential with the same mean so that we get a system of
  ODEs intead of PDEs?

* How do we compare the model results to data?

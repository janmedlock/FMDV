* Figure out what to do with all the untracked files in orphans/.

* Consider storing all events for the herd in an efficient data structure

* Figure out how to do population stats.
   
* Figure out how to bin by month.

* Do some sampling model to make sure the birth distribution is
  sensible.

* For talk:
   + Over herd sizes 100--1000
   + For maternal immunity waning between 3--9 months
   + Consider 1-d slices of herd size by maternal immunity waning time

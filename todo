* initial conditions
** The linear models give the same answer to 1e-3.
** Nonlinear models
*** unconditional probability
**** SAT1: 10.6min, hazard_infection = 153.8, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.958
**** SAT2: 13.8min, hazard_infection = 137.7, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.899
**** SAT3: 20.9min, hazard_infection =  82.9, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.907
*** conditional probability
**** SAT1: 10.9min, hazard_infection = 153.7, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.958
**** SAT2: 14.6min, hazard_infection = 137.6, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.899
**** SAT3: 21.0min, hazard_infection =  82.8, newborn_proportion_immune = 0.907

* Check hazards of infection => equilibrium prevalence for the SATs.
** Why are the density vs. age, summed over immune state, so different
   between the SATs? Is this the \Delta a terms in the analysis of the
   numerical scheme breaking things?
** What do hazards imply about prevalence?
*** Look at fraction in each state at equilibrium.
*** Look at hazard and S + L by SAT.
    How do these relate to each other?
*** Chronics => lots of transmission?
**  Could there be multiple equilibria?

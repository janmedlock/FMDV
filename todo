* Edit manuscript and methods.

* Run over population size and over birth variance.

* Run chronic model with posterior samples.

* Re-run acute samples since they weren't updating the initial
  conditions for different parameter values for the duration maternal
  immunity.

* Work on figures 3 & 4.

* Generate good initial condtions by solving PDEs.

* Figure out what to do with all the untracked files in /orphans/.

* Figure out how to do population stats.

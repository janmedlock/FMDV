* Think about not having all calves born with immunity.
** Make another parameter \phi for the fraction born with immunity,
   P_M(0) = \phi and P_S(0) = 1 - \phi.
   After solving, we can compute p as
   \phi = \frac{\sum_{X \in \{M, R, C\}} R_X}{\sum_X R_X},
   with
   R_X = \int_4^{+infty} P_X(a) q(a) da,
   where q(a) is the probability density of age a, from
   age_structure.  This parameter \phi and its post-solution value is
   another variable to add to the root finding.
** Approximate the above with
   \phi = \frac{\sum_{X \in \{M, R, C\}} R_X}{\sum_X R_X}
   and
   R_X = \int_4^{+infty} P_X(a) da.
   Since the \sum_X P_X(a) = 1 for all a, the denominator is constant,
   so we have a linear problem. This will require some work to define
   the matrices for the solver.
* Should we just solve for the equilibrium of the probability of being
  in state X at age a, *not* conditioned on being alive at age a? It's
  a simpler problem to explain...
  This makes the conditional probability
  P_X(a) = Q_X(a) / \sum_X Q_X(a),
  which can then be used with q(a), the probability density of age a,
  from age_structure for the initial conditions.
** What does that do to the problem in solving for the fraction born
   with immunity?
* For the initial conditions, what if we approximate the gamma waiting
  times by exponential with the same mean so that we get a system of
  ODEs intead of PDEs?

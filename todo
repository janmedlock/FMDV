* herd.initial_conditions.immune_status.Solver.get_pdf() now sets
  pdf[0] = 0.
** Should we see how (hazard_infection, newborn_proportion_immune)
   in herd.initial_conditions.immune_status.Solver.solve()
   change as we vary the value of pdf[0]?

* Should we use a subsample for samples_run.py instead of all 20,000?

* Need values of antibody-gain hazards and MCMC samples.

* Remove all .h5 files, samples_run/, figures, _cache dirs.

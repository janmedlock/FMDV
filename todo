* Figure out what to do with all the untracked files in orphans/.

* Consider storing all events for the herd in an efficient data structure
  (bisect) to avoid looping through the whole list.

* Figure out how to do population stats.
   
* Figure out how to bin by month.

* Do some sampling model to make sure the birth distribution is
  sensible.

* For talk:
   + Use Simon's parameters for each SAT type
   + Use natural birth timing distribution
   + Over herd sizes 100--1000
   + For maternal immunity waning between 3--9 months
   + Consider 1-d slices of herd size by maternal immunity waning time
   + Estimate likelihood of persistence by acute transmission only
     (with lifelong immunity after recovery)
   + Graphs of I vs t for a few realizations

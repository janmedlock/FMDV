\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics{../population_size}
  \caption{The sensitivity of extinction time of FMDV to buffalo
    population size.
    For each model and each SAT, the model was simulated for 1000 runs
    at population sizes 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900,
    1000 (baseline, dotted vertical lines), 2000, 3000, 4000, and
    5000.
    The other parameters were fixed at their baseline values.
    The top and middle rows of graphs show the distribution of
    FMDV extinction times for the model with only acute transmission
    and the model with both acute and carrier transmission,
    respectively.
    The bottom row shows the proportion of simulations where FMDV
    persisted in the buffalo population for the whole simulated
    10-year period for the model with both acute and carrier
    transmission.}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{../birth_seasonality}
  \caption{The sensitivity of extinction time to birth seasonality.
    For each model and each SAT, the model was simulated for
    1000 runs at 0, 0.5, 1 (baseline, dotted vertical lines), 1.5, and
    2 times the baseline birth seasonal coefficient of variation of
    0.613.
    The other parameters were fixed at their baseline values.
    The top and middle rows of graphs show the distribution of
    FMDV extinction times for the model with only acute transmission
    and the model with both acute and carrier transmission,
    respectively.
    The bottom row shows the proportion of simulations where FMDV
    persisted in the buffalo population for the whole simulated
    10-year period with both acute and carrier transmission.}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{../samples_sensitivity_acute}
  \caption{The sensitivity of FMDV extinction time to model
    parameters, for the model with only acute transmission.
    The sensitivity is measured by the partial rank correlation
    coefficient (PRCC). The model was simulated with each of 20,000
    samples from the posterior distributions of the parameters
    (Fig.~2; Extended Data Tables 1, 3).}
